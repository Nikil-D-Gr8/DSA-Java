        // Arrays in Java are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
        // For example, you can store multiple integers or strings in one array.

        // Important Points about Arrays in Java:
        System.out.println("1. Arrays in Java are fixed in size. Once defined, the size cannot be changed.");
        System.out.println("2. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.");
        System.out.println("3. Arrays can hold primitive types (like int, float, etc.) as well as object types (like String, custom objects, etc.).");
        System.out.println("4. Arrays are objects, so they are stored in heap memory, and their default values depend on the data type.");
        System.out.println("5. All elements in an array must be of the same data type; you cannot mix types in a single array.");


        System.out.println("Arrays provide a way to store multiple elements but are fixed in size and type!");
    }
